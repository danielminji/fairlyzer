CHAPTER FOUR

ANALYSIS & DISCUSSIONS

This chapter analyzes StudyMate's (also referred to UiTM Student Time Management
System) performance in great depth, outlining all its distinct characteristics. In addition
to comprehensive data, it provides important user feedback obtained from extensive
testing. Functionality testing was carefully carried out by an IT specialist to guarantee
that every feature works as intended. However, the chapter captures the voices of its
target audience, UiTM students, going beyond technical assessments. However, by
integrating non-UiTM students, the user-acceptance test expands its reach and offers
insightful information about how the system might perform with a larger user base.
This comprehensive strategy lays the groundwork for StudyMate's effective
deployment and best-in-class support for UiTM students by providing a complex
perspective of the platform's advantages and shortcomings.

Table 4.46 presents the accuracy of the system in sending reminders to students at the
specified times. The tests were conducted using three distinct time intervals: real-time
(0 minutes), 5 minutes prior, and 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time. The
values denote the lead time in minutes before the event for reminder delivery. Across
all five tests employing varied time intervals, all reminders were successfully received
by the students. This robust performance underscores the reliability of the reminder
system in promptly notifying students about their upcoming schedules.

CHAPTER FIVE

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This chapter discusses the conclusion of the StudyMate: UiTM Student Time
Management System. Additionally, recommendations are also covered in this section.
This marks the conclusion of all chapters within the report for this project.

5.1

Introduction

The StudyMate project, the UiTM Student Time Management System, initially aimed
to simplify tasks by providing a centralized platform for students to access their
schedules. The goal was to create a class timetable that could be easily viewed in one
place, eliminating the need to retrieve it repeatedly and avoiding scattered storage,
such as saving it in various unsuitable locations like personal WhatsApp messages for
future reference. However, after extensive brainstorming, numerous features were
identified for integration to enhance the system's robustness. Implementing the
functionality to receive reminders before the class starts was one of the notable ideas
incorporated into the project.

Implementing notification or reminders for tasks is not overly challenging. However,
determining what the message should contain and when the system should send the
reminder presents a crucial consideration. Opting for the schedule's title and
description, along with additional pertinent information, and sending the reminder at
the actual time elevates the system to another level. To address this, making the
message customizable enables users to manage the content, and allowing them to
specify how many minutes in advance they want the system to send the reminder
before the event starts provides a flexible solution.
203

Contemplating useful features can be complex, considering the myriad possibilities
for system implementation. Planning to add numerous features might lead to
incomplete implementation, as the system should primarily achieve its main objectives
and address current user issues. Prioritizing the attainment of objectives and problem
resolution takes precedence over feature upgrades. However, striking a balance is key
in managing this project.

5.2

Future Works

a) Diverse Platforms for Receiving Reminders
Currently, the system is integrated only with Telegram, allowing users to
receive notifications exclusively through that platform. However, expanding
the integration to multiple and diverse platforms would significantly enhance
the system. Users could then choose based on their preferences or even enable
notifications across all platforms. While implementing this functionality may
require a substantial amount of time, the resulting enhancement in user
satisfaction would justify the time invested in the implementation.

b) Integration with Various Universities or Colleges
Presently, the project named, "UiTM Student Time Management System" is
specifically designed for UiTM students but not limited to them. This implies
that users who are not UiTM students can still make use of the system's
features, except for the course section. The course section is a special module
integrated with the UiTM timetable, allowing users to fetch their class
timetable from the UiTM website. However, exploring the possibility of
integrating with other universities and colleges could be intriguing. This would
extend the convenience of the system to users from various educational
institutions.

204

5.3

Limitations

a) Single Platform for Receiving Reminders
Presently, the system exclusively utilizes Telegram to dispatch reminders to
students. Integration with other social or reminder platforms has not yet been
implemented.

b) Some Features Limited to UiTM Student Only
Although the system is accessible to all users, its timetable retrieval functionality
is tailored specifically for UiTM students at present. Students from other
universities or colleges can manually input their class timetables by specifying the
class type.

5.4

Summary

In conclusion, the StudyMate project, the UiTM Student Time Management System,
is designed to assist students in managing their time effectively. However, the system's
effectiveness relies on the users being punctual, responsible, and willing to manage
their time wisely. The project is developed as a tool to aid students in time
management. Conveniently receiving reminders before class times and task deadlines
may contribute to students' success in their academic and professional endeavors.
Having a robust integration with the UiTM website simplifies the process for UiTM
students to access their timetables. This, coupled with the easily enabled reminder
feature in the settings, ensures that students receive timely reminders before each class
begins.
